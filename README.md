# hello-world
I am Constantine and this is me and my ideas<br>

I am interested into projects that contain:
<ul>
<li> Web Applications Front-End <b>especially React </li>
<li> I like functional programming and I am in my early stage and I like it </li>
<li> RxJS is intriguing and I finally managed to understand how to use switchMap! </li>
<li> I am currently learning Unit Testing! </li>
</ul>
