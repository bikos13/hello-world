# hello-world
I am Constantine and this is me and my ideas<br>

I am interested into projects that contain:
<ul>
  <li> Web Applications Front-End <b>especially React </b> </li>
  <li> I am currently practicing <b>functional programming</b> and I am in my early stage and I like it </li>
  <li> <b>RxJS</b> is intriguing and I finally managed to understand how to use switchMap! </li>
  <li> I am currently learning <b>Unit Testing</b>! </li>
</ul>
